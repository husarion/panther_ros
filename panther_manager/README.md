- `battery.percent.threshold.critical` [*float*, default: **0.1**]: If the Battery percentage drops below this value, an animation indicating a critical Battery state will start being displayed.
- `battery.percent.threshold.low` [*float*, default: **0.4**]: If the Battery percentage drops below this value, the animation indicating a low Battery state will start being displayed.
- `battery.percent.window_len` [*int*, default: **6**]: Moving average window length used to smooth out Battery percentage readings.
- `bt_project_path` [*string*, default: **$(find panther_manager)/config/PantherBT.btproj**]: Path to a BehaviorTree project.
- `plugin_libs` [*list*, default: **Empty list**]: List with names of plugins that are used in the BT project.
- `ros_plugin_libs` [*list*, default: **Empty list**]: List with names of ROS plugins that are used in a BT project.
- `timer_frequency` [*float*, default: **10.0**]: Frequency **[Hz]** at which lights tree will be ticked.

### safety_manager_node

Node responsible for managing safety features, and software shutdown of components.

#### Subscribers

- `battery/battery_status` [*sensor_msgs/BatteryState*]: State of the internal Battery.
- `hardware/e_stop` [*std_msgs/Bool*]: State of emergency stop.
- `hardware/io_state` [*panther_msgs/IOState*]: State of IO pins.
- `hardware/motor_controllers_state` [*panther_msgs/DriverState*]: State of motor controllers.
- `system_status` [*panther_msgs/SystemStatus*]: Built-in computer system status, includes the most important computation-related parameters.

#### Service Clients (for Default Trees)

- `~/hardware/aux_power_enable` [*std_srvs/SetBool*]: Enables Aux Power output.
- `~/hardware/e_stop_trigger` [*std_srvs/Trigger*]: Triggers E-stop.
- `~/hardware/fan_enable` [*std_srvs/SetBool*]: Enables fan.

#### Parameters

- `battery.temp.window_len` [*int*, default: **6**]: Moving average window length used to smooth out temperature readings of the Battery.
- `bt_project_path` [*string*, default: **$(find panther_manager)/config/PantherBT.btproj**]: Path to a BehaviorTree project.
- `cpu.temp.fan_off` [*float*, default: **60.0**]: Temperature in **[&deg;C]** of the Built-in Computer's CPU, below which the fan is turned off.
- `cpu.temp.fan_on` [*float*, default: **70.0**]: Temperature in **[&deg;C]** of the Built-in Computer's CPU, above which the fan is turned on.
- `cpu.temp.window_len` [*int*, default: **6**]: Moving average window length used to smooth out temperature readings of the Built-in Computer's CPU.
- `driver.temp.fan_off` [*float*, default: **35.0**]: Temperature in **[&deg;C]** of any drivers below which the fan is turned off.
- `driver.temp.fan_on` [*float*, default: **45.0**]: Temperature in **[&deg;C]** of any drivers above which the fan is turned on.
- `driver.temp.window_len` [*int*, default: **6**]: Moving average window length used to smooth out the temperature readings of each driver.
- `fan_turn_off_timeout` [*float*, default: **60.0**]: Minimal time in **[s]**, after which the fan may be turned off.
- `plugin_libs` [*list*, default: **Empty list**]: List with names of plugins that are used in the BT project.
- `ros_plugin_libs` [*list*, default: **Empty list**]: List with names of ROS plugins that are used in a BT project.
- `shutdown_hosts_path` [*string*, default: **None**]: Path to a YAML file containing a list of hosts to request shutdown. To correctly format the YAML file, include a **hosts** field consisting of a list with the following fields:
